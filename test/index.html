        <p>
            You may have noticed how unusual this website is compared to the others.
             I'm not going to talk about food or drinks, or milked-jelly beans (yes, sadly, somebody provided a recipe for that), or bombard you with animations. 
             Instead, I'm going to discuss with you man-kinds greatest perdicament; death. 
        </p>

        <p>Scientists estimate that over 100 billion humans have ever lived, and seeing how there's only 7 billion now, we can assume they're dead. 
            Now out of all these meaningless deaths, some are actually for a good cause, but  for now we are going to focus on the more <strong>meaningless</strong> deaths.
            In particular, two cases that standout from the rest: death by flying turtle, and death by laughter. 
        </p>

        <h2>A Killer Headache</h2>
        <p>Ascehylus, a Greek academic and avid supersitionist, once heard a prophecy he would be killed 
            by a falling house. Upon hearing this from an Oracle, he good ol' Ace decided to stay outdoors to avoid his demise.</p>
        <p>While Ace was sitting on a rock, doing what philosphers do, an eagle mistakened his bald, shiny head for a rock. That eagle,
            a member of the Cincerous Vulture species, happened to need a sturdy rock to crack his prey's (a turtle) shell on, and dropped it on his head. 
            Needless to say, that didn't end well for our friend or the eagle.

        <h2>Death of Comical Porportions</h2>
        <p>
            This Greek painter met his end with joy: after an elderly woman commissioned a painting of the godess of beauty (Aphrodite) and 
            insisted she be the model for it. Zeuxis of Heraclea considered her request so absurd, he proceeded to laugh so much he fell to the ground and died of asphyxiation.
